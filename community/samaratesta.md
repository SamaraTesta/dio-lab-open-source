**Data analyst, Technology**

I am a naturally curious and focused person, I like to explore challenging situations and solve problems. As a professional I have diverse training and experiences, I like to work in a collaborative and multidisciplinary way.

I currently intend to migrate to the technology area as a Data Analyst, so I recently completed the Google Data Analyst professional course in partnership with Coursera. In this course I developed skills in R, SQL and Google Sheets.
